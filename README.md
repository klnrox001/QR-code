## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I learnt more about utilizing 'flexbox' when trying to recreate the QR component design. I struggled getting the 'paragraph' font to a suitable size within the container. I found that with percentage, I could get to the closest 'font-size' as seen in the design. What really helped me was using Live Server. I would use Inspect and changed things on there and once I was happy with what I saw, I added the changes to my code. 

 I hope to become more capable with more practice and research. 


### Continued development

I need to revise 'flexbox' and my code needs to be more streamlined, I feel? Not sure, but I did what I could.
